# GitHub Lab

`github-lab` is a collection of scripts and artifacts aimed at supporting various GitHub analysis projects. This repository contains tools to automate the creation, modification, and tracking of local Git repositories over time. It can be used in conjunction with other repositories that house the analysis results.

## Overview

One of the key scripts in this repository is `runner.sh`, which processes a list of Git commands stored in a file called `commands.gtd` (Git Database). The main goal of the script is to create a local Git repository, perform a series of actions on it, and then take snapshots of the repository's state over time, storing them in a subdirectory called `git-db-tracker`.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Separation of commands**: `runner.sh` reads commands from `commands.gtd` to initialize and manage a local Git repository based on the provided parameter. A sample `commands.gtd` file is included.
- **Snapshots**: The script periodically captures snapshots of the directory state, saving the snapshots in the `snapshots` subdirectory.
- **Customizable Git Commands**: The `commands.gtd` file can be customized with any sequence of Git commands or other shell commands that will be executed by `runner.sh`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
- **Warning**: `runner.sh` reads commands from `commands.gtd` to initialize and manage a local Git repository based on the provided parameter. There aren't any precautions taken to sanitize what you put in commands.gtd. You can do very bad things if you're not careful!

## Usage

1. **Prepare `commands.gtd`**: Create a `commands.gtd` file in the repository root, listing the commands you want to execute, including Git commands for initializing and managing a local repository. Be very cautious about what you include in this file! Be sure to include a newline at the end of the file.
   
   Example `commands.gtd`:
   ```bash
   git init
   echo "README" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
2. **Run runner.sh** `commands.gtd`**: `runner.sh` takes a parameter that is the name of the subdirectory you want to create.

   Example `runner.sh usage`:
   ```bash
   ./runner.sh explore-init
   ```

3. **Output**: `runner.sh` will iterate over `commands.gtd` executing the lines one-by-one. A snapshot of the directory will be taken with each successive command and placed in a subdirectory `git-db-tracker/`. Here's an example run:

    The `explore-init` subdirectory is created in `git-db-tracker` with a timestamped folder for each command. `20241018120127` corresponds to `git init`; `20241018120128` corresponds to `echo "README" > README.md`, etc. Using a comparison tool such as Beyond Compare, we can easily inspect the changes to the `.git` folder over time in the context of changes to the working tree and various `git` commands.

    Now we can visually compare `20241018120127` with `20241018120130` to understand the evolution of `.git`.

    A log can be found at script.log showing the items, results and snapshot directories.

## üõ†Ô∏è File Structure

- **runner.sh**: The main script that processes the commands.gtd file and manages the Git repository lifecycle.
- **commands.gtd**: A text file containing Git commands for runner.sh to execute.
- **git-db-tracker/**: A subdirectory where snapshots of the Git repository are stored over time.
